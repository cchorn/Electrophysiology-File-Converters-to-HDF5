# Electrophysiology-File-Converters-to-HDF5

This repository contains a Python code to convert electrophysiology files to Numpy arrays and save to HDF5 (https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)

# Currently included file converters
* Spike2, CED: includes the Python script, Jupyter notebook, and example Spike2 data
* More to come ...


# Dependencies
* Python
* Jupyter (required for using the notebook to run the Python script)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Neo (these converters make heavy use of the Neo package)
